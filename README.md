Setting up the Environment:

To enable facial detection, you need to install OpenCV. Simply use pip to install OpenCV by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt: pip install opencv-python.

Readme:

This code utilizes the Haar cascade classifier, which is a part of OpenCV's data directory, for facial detection. The classifier is employed to locate and distinguish faces in the video stream.

To initiate the camera object, the code uses cv2.VideoCapture(). In case you prefer using a video clip instead of a camera, you can specify the file name as an argument during the function call.

The loop iterates through the camera frames using the read() function. Each frame is then converted to grayscale using the cv2 function. Grayscale images offer better efficiency for the algorithm.

The detectMultiScale() function of the cascade classifier identifies faces within the grayscale image. It returns a list of rectangular regions containing potential facial recognition features. You have control over three factors that allow customization of the algorithm's sensitivity and accuracy. By adjusting these variables, you can enhance the algorithm's precision in various scenarios.

Finally, the program draws rectangles around the recognized facial features using cv2.rectangle(). The frames with rectangles are displayed using cv2.imshow(). To exit the loop, simply press the 'q' key, which is managed by the cv2.waitKey() function.

Upon loop termination, the camera object is released, and all windows are closed using cv2.destroyAllWindows().
